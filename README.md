# SoftwareEngineering

This repository includes material for Chico State's graduate software engineering class, CSCI 630

## Course Syllabus

### Overview

In an advanced study of software engineering, students will refine skills including version control, software testing, and evaluating software quality using modern technologies. Students will collaborate in a distributed software development environment and establish online portfolios by contributing to open source projects and interacting with popular software engineering communities.

*Prerequisites*: CSCI 430 and classified graduate standing.

### Required Materials

No textbook required.

A laptop computer will be needed for all course meetings.

### Course Grades

Each assignment is graded on an 100 point scale and then weighted according to the following distribution:

* **Project** 75%
* **Quizzes** (~4) 15%
* **Exercises** 10%

### Project

For the entire semester, each student will be assigned to a specific open source project. Students are expected to learn about the existing project and become a meaningful contributor to it. This will involve communicating with the existing community and contributions can include:

* Code maintenance and updating
* Documentation
* Bug logging
* Fixing bugs
* Development environment maintenance and updating

Multiple students will contribute to the same project. However, each student will be expected to make (and demonstrate) individual contributions. Each week, every student should create a work log entry (on Blackboard Learn > Work Log) that includes one-sentence summaries for:

* What I've done
* What "blockers" I have
* What I am going to do next week
