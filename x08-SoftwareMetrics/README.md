# Software Metrics

Starting next week, we will cover software quality metrics. Each student is responsible for signing up with a partner to prepare a lesson on one particular metric. To sign up, fork this repo and edit this file to add you and your partner's name to the list.

You will be allowed an entire lecture to deliver your lesson, so it may take up to 50 minutes. Your lesson should include some explanation and examples, but it is recommended to organize a hands-on activity to help your classmates learn the material. However, you may not assign any "homework" or graded assignments.
