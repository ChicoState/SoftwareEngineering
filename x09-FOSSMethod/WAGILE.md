From what I have observed from working on the FOSS Vault, there seem to be
main contributors as well as part time contributors. I think if I were to 
start a FOSS, it would be with myself and a few key contributors. I would
use the waterfall method in our small group to crank out a fully functional
prototype. I would choose waterfall to start with because I believe that in
the beginning of development of FOSS, you know pretty clearly what you and
your group are trying to accomplish, and I think waterfall is good for 
getting an initial prototype. After the initial build has been completed,
a public github repo would be created for anyone to be able to use and 
contribute to the project. I think at this point switching to an AGILE 
method would be most advantageous, because the projectwill be open for 
a number of revisions based on user/contributor input and
likely the program will undergo and number of smaller changes.
Keeping the "issue" list well documented and maintained will make it easy
to keep track of what problems are present and who is working on them. For
this reason I will call the development method WAGILE, for starting with
a Waterfall approach for use by the main developers, but once the project
goes public switch to AGILE for easy adaptability.
